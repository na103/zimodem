# Noisy Zimodem
Noisy Zimodem is an ESP32 with Zimodem firmware by Bo Zimmerman https://github.com/bozimmerman/Zimodem (thanks to Bo for his fantastic work) to which I added a TTL-RS232 interface converter, a PCM5102 DAC and a mini LM386 to play sounds.
<br>
handshaking and dial tone sound is inside source code and the result, who can you see in this video, is very similar an old fashioned modem.
